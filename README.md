# NVIDIA AI Workbench: Introduction
This is an [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/develop-and-deploy-scalable-generative-ai-models-seamlessly-with-nvidia-ai-workbench/) example Project that demonstrates how to train a Large Language Model to annotate large sections of text with realistic punctuation and capitalization using the NeMo Framework. We will conduct data preprocessing, model configuration, model training, and model inference on new text to evaluate performance. Users in the [AI Workbench Early Access Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/ai-workbench-early-access) can get up and running with this Project in minutes.

## Project Description
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems typically generate text with no punctuation and capitalization of the words. This tutorial explains how to implement a model in NeMo that will predict punctuation and capitalization for each word in a sentence to make ASR output more readable and to boost performance of the named entity recognition, machine translation or text-to-speech models. We'll show how to train a model for this task using a pre-trained BERT model. For every word in our training dataset weâ€™re going to predict:

* punctuation mark that should follow the word and

* whether the word should be capitalized

## System Requirements:
* Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
* CPU requirements: None, tested with Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Gold 6240R CPU @ 2.40GHz
* GPU requirements: Any NVIDIA training GPU, tested with NVIDIA A100-40GB
* NVIDIA driver requirements: Latest driver version
* Storage requirements: 40GB

# Quickstart
The notebook(s) in this project were adapted from the NVIDIA NeMo Github repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/tutorials/nlp).
